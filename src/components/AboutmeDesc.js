          <p> Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Ameen Abdulrasheed (yes, the surname has its own charm ðŸ˜‰). Split between Lagos and Ilorin ,Nigeria , Iâ€™m here to build meaningful connections as lifeâ€™s "playtime" evolves into deeper chapters.</p>
          <p>I turn data into stories and solutions as a Data Scientist & Engineer (in view). By day, I code in Python/SQL, analyze trends, and engineer software (Flask, React, JS). By night? Iâ€™m probably geeking out over anime, tweaking my <a href='https://py-blog-two.vercel.app'>blog</a>, or taking midnight strolls under a cozy weather</p>
